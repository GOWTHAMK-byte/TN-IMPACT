Project Title

Unified Employee Service Platform (Mobile + Backend)

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a production-ready, enterprise-grade Unified Employee Service Mobile Application that consolidates HR, IT, Finance, and Administrative services into a single mobile app with secure backend integration.

The system must be modular, scalable, secure, and role-based.

This is NOT a UI prototype. Build full-stack.
